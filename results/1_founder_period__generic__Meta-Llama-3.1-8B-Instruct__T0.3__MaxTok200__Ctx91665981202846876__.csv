Problem: A new company must select an initial market entry strategy to prove its concept and secure future funding, despite lacking a proven supply chain, manufacturing assets, and brand recognition. The core challenge is to create a compelling and differentiated narrative while managing a high capital risk.

Additional context (subset may be empty):
- [Technology] Li-ion cell cost: ~1,000 USD/kWh. Lithium-ion cell costs were around ~1,000 USD per kWh.
- [Finance] Initial funding: ~USD 7.5M Series A (private). Initial external funding amounted to approximately USD 7.5 million in a Series A round, indicating limited capital.

Candidate execution options (choose EXACTLY ONE):
  A) Build a portfolio of hybrid/fuel cell vehicles
  B) Develop a high-performance EV sports car
  C) Co-develop an EV platform with a major automaker

Standard strategy mappings:
  A → Fast Follower
