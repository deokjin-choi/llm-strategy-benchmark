Problem: A new company must select an initial market entry strategy to prove its concept and secure future funding, despite lacking a proven supply chain, manufacturing assets, and brand recognition. The core challenge is to create a compelling and differentiated narrative while managing a high capital risk.

Additional context (subset may be empty):
- [Technology] Prototype performance: 0–60 mph in 3.6 s; ~300 km range. A high-performance prototype achieved 0–60 mph in ~3.6 seconds with ~300 km range, demonstrating the performance potential of EVs.
- [Market] Incumbent focus: Established automakers concentrated on hybrid and fuel cell technologies, not pure EVs. Major automakers at the time were focused on hybrid and fuel cell technologies, not pure electric vehicles.

Candidate execution options (choose EXACTLY ONE):
  A) Build a portfolio of hybrid/fuel cell vehicles
  B) Develop a high-performance EV sports car
  C) Co-develop an EV platform with a major automaker
