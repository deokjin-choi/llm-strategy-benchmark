Additional context (subset may be empty):
- [Market] EV share: <0.02% of global new car sales. Battery electric vehicles accounted for less than ~0.02% of global new car sales.
- [Technology] Li-ion cell cost: ~1,000 USD/kWh. Lithium-ion cell costs were around ~1,000 USD per kWh.
- [Technology] Prototype performance: 0–60 mph in 3.6 s; ~300 km range. A high-performance prototype achieved 0–60 mph in ~3.6 seconds with ~300 km range, demonstrating the performance potential of EVs.
- [Finance] Initial funding: ~USD 7.5M Series A (private). Initial external funding amounted to approximately USD 7.5 million in a Series A round, indicating limited capital.
