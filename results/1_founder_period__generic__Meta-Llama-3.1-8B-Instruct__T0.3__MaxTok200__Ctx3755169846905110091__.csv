Problem (ALWAYS INCLUDED):
Problem: A new company must select an initial market entry strategy to prove its concept and secure future funding, despite lacking a proven supply chain, manufacturing assets, and brand recognition. The core challenge is to create a compelling and differentiated narrative while managing a high capital risk.

Additional context (subset may be empty):
- [Market] EV share: <0.02% of global new car sales. Battery electric vehicles accounted for less than ~0.02% of global new car sales.
- [Technology] Li-ion cell cost: ~1,000 USD/kWh. Lithium-ion cell costs were around ~1,000 USD per kWh.
