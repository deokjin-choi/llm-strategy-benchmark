Problem: A new company must select an initial market entry strategy to prove its concept and secure future funding, despite lacking a proven supply chain, manufacturing assets, and brand recognition. The core challenge is to create a compelling and differentiated narrative while managing a high capital risk.

Additional context (subset may be empty):
- [Technology] Prototype performance: 0–60 mph in 3.6 s; ~300 km range. A high-performance prototype achieved 0–60 mph in ~3.6 seconds with ~300 km range, demonstrating the performance potential of EVs.
- [Market] Incumbent focus: Established automakers concentrated on hybrid and fuel cell technologies, not pure EVs. Major automakers at the time were focused on hybrid and fuel cell technologies, not pure electric vehicles.
