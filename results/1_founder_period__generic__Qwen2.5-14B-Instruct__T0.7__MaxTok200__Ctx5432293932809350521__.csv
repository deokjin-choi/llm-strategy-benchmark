Given the fixed problem and a subset of context blocks (which may be empty), select the single most appropriate execution option and justify it clearly.

Problem (ALWAYS INCLUDED):
Problem: A new company must select an initial market entry strategy to prove its concept and secure future funding, despite lacking a proven supply chain, manufacturing assets, and brand recognition. The core challenge is to create a compelling and differentiated narrative while managing a high capital risk.

Additional context (subset may be empty):
- [Technology] Li-ion cell cost: ~1,000 USD/kWh. Lithium-ion cell costs were around ~1,000 USD per kWh.
- [Market] Incumbent focus: Established automakers concentrated on hybrid and fuel cell technologies, not pure EVs. Major automakers at the time were focused on hybrid and fuel cell technologies, not pure electric vehicles.

Candidate execution options (choose EXACTLY ONE):
  A) Build a portfolio of hybrid/fuel cell vehicles
  B) Develop a high-performance EV sports car
  C) Co-develop an EV platform with a major automaker

Standard strategy mappings:
