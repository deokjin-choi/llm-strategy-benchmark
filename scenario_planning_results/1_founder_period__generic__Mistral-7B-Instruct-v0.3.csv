The company faced three key risks:

2. Supply Chain Risk: The lack of a proven supply chain could lead to delays and increased costs.
3. Brand Recognition Risk: Entering a crowded market with no established brand could make it difficult to gain traction.

Despite these challenges, the company had three potential opportunities:
1. Market Opportunity: The growing awareness and acceptance of EVs presented an opportunity for the company to capitalize on the shift towards cleaner, more sustainable transportation.
2. Technology Opportunity: The company's high-performance prototype demonstrated its technical prowess, which could attract investors and partners.
3. Competitive Opportunity: The focus of incumbents on hybrid and fuel cell technologies created a niche for the company to differentiate itself by focusing on pure EVs.""
